# Framingham Heart Study Dataset
## Overview
The Framingham Heart Study dataset includes information collected from participants to understand risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. 
This dataset is useful for predictive modeling and analysis of heart disease risk.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

1. male: Gender of the participant (1 for male, 0 for female).
2. age: Age of the participant.
3. education: Level of education (1-4 scale).
4. currentSmoker: Indicates if the participant is a current smoker (1 for yes, 0 for no).
5. cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked per day.
6. BPMeds: Indicates if the participant is on blood pressure medication (1 for yes, 0 for no).
7. prevalentStroke: Indicates if the participant has had a stroke (1 for yes, 0 for no).
8. prevalentHyp: Indicates if the participant has high blood pressure (1 for yes, 0 for no).
9. diabetes: Indicates if the participant has diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no).
10. totChol: Total cholesterol level (mg/dL).
11. sysBP: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg).
12. diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).
13. BMI: Body mass index (kg/mÂ²).
14. heartRate: Heart rate (beats per minute).
15. glucose: Blood glucose level (mg/dL).
16. TenYearCHD: Indicates if the participant has coronary heart disease (CHD) within 10 years (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Learning outcomes
This dataset is suitable for:
Supervised Learning:
Predicting the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease (TenYearCHD) based on various health and demographic features.
Classification models such as logistic regression or decision trees.
